The CMD file needs to be located in the .\host directory to fully function.

At this time, 05/05/2019, only SNES is built out and in testing, even though menus for the other systems appear.

Any issues, please let me know with screenshots. While this is simply a frontend, it's purpose is to make sure correct dumping of cartridges occurs.
