<br/><br/> 
### Battle of Olympus, The
Regardless of method tried, the mapper will only read `FF` for all data banks. With the exception of the header, none of the actual data is being written to the ROM file.

Mapper Modifications Attempted:
- Standard MMC1 initialization (original working approach). 
- Mode 2/3 approaches (different PRG banking modes).
- Direct memory access (bypassing mapper functions)
- MMC3-style approach (mimicking MMC3 game detection)
- No initialization (reading immediately after CHR-ROM ID)
- [Kevtris](http://kevtris.org/mappers/mmc1/index.html) approach (based on Kevtris documentation)
- [emudev](https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/MMC1) approach (based on emudev documentation)
- [Mario's Right Nut](https://mariosrightnut.com/nintendo/mmc1/) approach (based on assembly tutorial)
- [Mouse Bite Labs](https://mousebitelabs.com/2021/01/27/nes-reproduction-board-guide-mmc1/) approach (based on reproduction board guide) 
- Standard MMC1 with proper 5-write sequences (exact working game init)
- Real NES power-on sequence (mimicking actual NES boot)


<br/><br/> 
### Mappy-Land (Famicom)
The `NAMCOT-3415` mapper is not officially supported in INL-Retro, nor is `DxROM`, which online sources suggest as its default mapping configuration. A provisional implementation of the mapper has been placed in `hosts/scripts/nes/namcot3415.lua` for further review and refinement. Since I'm unable to get it to work, the hope is for another developer to examine the code, interpret its behavior, and potentially achieve functional support. Currently, only one other title, `Family Circuit`, utilizes this mapper.

What was tested:
- Mappers Tested:
	- Mapper 0 (NROM) - Multiple configurations
	- Mapper 1 (MMC1) - Standard approach
	- Mapper 4 (MMC3) - With MMC3-style bank switching
	- Mapper 206 (NAMCOT-3415) - Original mapper name

- ROM Size Combinations:
	- 128KB PRG + 32KB CHR (161KB total)

- Mirroring Options:
	- Horizontal mirroring (worked for Son Son)

- PRG ROM Reading Methods:
	- Simple approach - 4 reads of 32KB each
	- Smaller reads - 8 reads of 16KB each
	- MMC3-style bank switching - 16 banks of 8KB each
	- NAMCOT-3415-style bank switching - Various bank configurations

- CHR ROM Reading Methods:
	- Standard reading - 4 reads of 8KB each
	- Multiple-pass reading - 3 passes with majority voting (worked for Spelunker)
	- Direct byte-by-byte reading - Manual reading of each byte
	- 8KB range (0x0000-0x1FFF)
	- 32KB range (0x0000-0x7FFF)

- Results:
	- All combinations resulted in: Green screens, crashes, garbled graphics, or no response
	- Best outcome: Got sound and some graphics but still garbled against MMC3 mapper

### Final Fantasy II (version 1.1)
The INL Retro Dumper cannot read Final Fantasy II v1.1’s SRAM due to unsupported access methods in its current firmware (2.3.x). Assumption is the limitation is on the dumper side, not the cartridge. Proprietary SRAM interface unique to version 1.1, unsupported by current INL Retro Dumper.

1. Basic SRAM Access Methods
	- Tested standard LoROM access at 0x8000 via ROM bus.
	- Tried system bus access at 0x6000 and 0x0000.
	- Cycled through SRAM banks (0x70–0x77).
	- Scanned multiple address ranges (0x0000, 0x2000, 0x4000, 0x6000, 0x8000).

2. Game-Specific Initialization
	- Implemented “game-driven init” by reading reset vector and adding delays.
	- Tested multiple SRAM enable sequences and register write patterns.
	- Adjusted timing delays (10ms, 100ms, 500ms, 1s).

3. Advanced Access Methods
	- Followed SNES Development Manual guidelines using Work RAM registers (2180h–2183h). https://archive.org/details/SNESDevManual/book1/page/n3/mode/2up
	- Scanned entire SNES memory space (banks $70–$7D, $700000–$7DFFFF).
	- Created comprehensive diagnostic dumps and tested different bus types (ROM vs. system).

4. Version-Specific Handling
	- Detected ROM header version 1.1 (0x0001) versus 1.0.
	- Noted unusual expansion RAM size value 0xD0, suggesting a special cartridge type.
	- Attempted version-specific access variations.

5. Diagnostic Approaches
	- Compared hex data with working Mesen emulator save files.
	- Analyzed address patterns from related games (e.g., Zelda: $1082, $1882, $1D02).
	- Performed full memory scans in 4KB increments across all banks.
	- Generated and reviewed multiple diagnostic dumps.

6. Technical Methods Used
	- Utilized the following commands:
		- SNES_ROM_RD, 
		- SNES_SYS_RD, 
		- SNES_ROM_WR, 
		- SNES_SYS_WR, 
		- SNES_SET_BANK
	- Work RAM register access via 2180h–2183h
